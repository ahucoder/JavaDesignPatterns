# Java Design Patterns

A comprehensive collection of Java design pattern implementations, including the 23 GoF patterns as well as additional patterns commonly used in modern development. Each pattern includes detailed explanations, UML diagrams, and real-world example code.

## Why Learn Design Patterns?

Design patterns offer reusable solutions to common software development problems. They provide:

* **Proven Solutions**: Time-tested approaches to specific challenges
* **Code Reusability**: Reduce duplicated code
* **Maintainability**: Make code easier to understand and modify
* **Team Collaboration**: Provide a shared design vocabulary

* Java 21
* Maven 3.6+

### Running Examples

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ahucoder/JavaDesignPatterns.git
   cd JavaDesignPatterns
   ```

   ```

## Design Principles

This project strives to follow the SOLID design principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has only one responsibility
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Open for extension, closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend upon abstractions, not concretions
